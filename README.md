**Matching people with the help they need**

## Development

We would love your help! As a general guideline for commits, please refer to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 

To get setup, simply install and run the development server. 

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

## Deployment

```bash
# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
